# 🔍 Malicious Web Traffic Analysis – A Walkthrough from the Field
**Posted by Anthony | Cybersecurity Analyst | April 2025**

## 🧠 Introduction
In this post, I’ll walk you through a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge I completed recently on LetsDefend, focused on analyzing malicious web traffic. The scenario was based on a real-world investigation into suspicious network behavior. What followed was a fascinating chain of exploitation—from an XML External Entity attack to brute-force access, file enumeration, and even an open redirect.

Let’s break down the attack chain step by step and uncover what the adversary did and how they did it.

## 🖥️ Phase 1: Finding the Web Server and Attacker
The first step in the investigation involved analyzing a PCAP file. Within seconds, a couple of IP addresses stood out:
- **Web Server IP**: 10.1.0.4
- **Attacker IP**: 197.32.212.121 – This external address attempted a number of RDP connections (port 3389) to the web server. That’s an immediate red flag.

## 📦 Phase 2: Exploiting an XXE Vulnerability
Looking deeper, I noticed multiple HTTP POST requests to `/register/register.php`. One request carried a particularly suspicious XML payload:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE replace [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=register.php">
]>
